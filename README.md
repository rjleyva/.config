Iâ€™ve always believed that the tools we use not only shape our workflow but also influence our mindset and creativity. Inspired by Josean Martinezâ€™s Neovim setup, I began my own journey to craft a personalized, efficient workspace.

I have a deep respect for Folkeâ€™s work and have spent a lot of time exploring his LazyVim distribution. While itâ€™s an amazing tool, I wanted a fresh start something I could build from the ground up. Thatâ€™s why I transitioned to Joseanâ€™s personal configuration as a foundation, gradually tweaking it to fit my evolving workflow. So far, Iâ€™ve removed the status line, simplified the dashboard, and embraced a more minimalist approach to help me focus on what truly matters.

One of my favorite elements is the Solarized Osaka colorscheme by Takuya Matsuyama. Its perfectly balanced tones create an environment thatâ€™s both calming and energizing, exactly what I need for deep focus.

## Why This Exists

This repository serves as:

- A personal reference for my evolving Neovim configuration.
- A way to document and refine my workflow over time.
